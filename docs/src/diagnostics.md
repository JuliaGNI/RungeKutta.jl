# Diagnostics

Currently, diagnostic functions for checking symmetry, symplecticity and the so-called simplifying assumptions are implemented:

* `issymmetric(tab)`
* `issymplectic(tab)`
* `satisfies_simplifying_assumption_b(tab, σ=tab.s)`
* `satisfies_simplifying_assumption_c(tab, σ=tab.s)`
* `satisfies_simplifying_assumption_d(tab, σ=tab.s)`

This list is expected to grow in the future.
